# Color-Blindness-Correction
This project was created with the idea of transforming social media platforms and other posts into a much better visaulization for color blind people .  This project works around with the pixels and transforms the given color pixels into another color which will be visible by the color blind user. This model can be implemented with various technologies and thus can be used on a larger scale for various purposes. At the moment this model works on capturing the live video frames through web-cams and then converting the areas of color which are not visible by color deficiant people into the color which is visible through their eyes .
